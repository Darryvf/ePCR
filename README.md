How to use this project
====

This project cas created to be used on iOS. It is using Cordova (Phonegap) to make use of the device hardware (camera for example).
To compile the .project file, you will need XCode 4.
However, you can still use the www folder to use this project as a web app. You will have to strip some code specific to cordova though.
